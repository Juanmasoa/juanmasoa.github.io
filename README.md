## The History of Internet
### Key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today
-	In 1983 Defense of USA uses the TCP / IP protocol in its Arpanet network.
-	1989: Tim Berners Lee describes the protocol of hypertext transfers that would lead to the first web using three new resources: HTML, HTTP and Web Browser. 
-	1990: the Internet is born in a closed form within CERN. 
-	1991: external users to CERN begin to access this information.
-	1993: Mosaic web browser is created. It is the first to show images in line with text, as other graphical user interface norms (eg.: browser’s URL address bar and back/forward/reload options for viewing webpages.)
-	1995: the NSFNET is decommissioned.
-	1996: Internet2 project is initiated by 34 universities, Service Providers begin appearing such as Sprint and MCI and Nokia releases first cell phone with internet access.
-	1999: 802.11b, a wireless technology, referred to as Wi-Fi, is standardized.
-	2005: Youtube launches.


### Relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers
1.	User types a web address into the browser.
2.	Browser goes to a special server called DNS, which matchs up that web address typed into the browser (the domain) to the website's real IP address.
3.	The browser sends an HTTP request message to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website to the client. This message, and all other data sent between the client and the server, is sent across your internet connection using TCP/IP.
4.	If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a "200 OK" message, and then starts sending the website's files to the browser as a series of small chunks called data packets (this división is necessary to make the web available for more than one user at a time).
5.	The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete website and displays it to you.


### One aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today.
The internet has reinvented **communication**. The continuous advances have led to the appearance of numerous methods of electronic communication, eg.: social networking websites, emails, voicemails, and video conferences. 

These advanced communication tech tools have helped us to eliminate time and distance as obstacles to effective communication. This is beneficial to our personal relationships, to education and to business. Technology has improved cultural education by giving students the opportunity to communicate with others overseas.

Three fields in which communication improvement is straightforward are:
1. Expression/Consumption of expertise : news came from a limited number of sources and at few times. Now there are unlimited sources (cable news networks, blogs, newsfeeds, tweets…, pique 24/7.
2. Finding a partner: Tinder has (sadly) substituted bars.
3. Keeping in touch: letters have been replaced by Social Media, online messaging services…

It´s necessary to find a balance between the cyber world and real world.
