            <h2>A little of history...</h2>
            <p>I am a Spanish guy born in Madrid and really fond of his family hometown, in the South of Spain. Moreover, I started living on a 4th of march, so the Pisces character has accompanied me all along my path, emerging as poetry and (not many and not good, yet) scripts and tales.</p>
            <p>Really close to my friends and family, I try to get the best of every situation, either good or less good.</p>
            <p>I love travelling, reading, cinema, learning, learning, learning, ... </p>

        <p>My parents taught me that to achieve my goals I had to <span>work hard</span>, and that is a lesson I have never forgotten nor stop applying.</p>
        <p>As I became older, thanks to experience and people I met, I constantly developed an <span>open-minded</span> personality, which allowed me to continue experiencing enriching situations and meeting so interesting people.</p>
        <p>Now, at the age of 24, I am at the pursuit of knowledge I can apply to my projects (yeah, I am an entrepreneur too!) and life, and I hope one day I will be prepared enough to transmit all my expertise to other people, in order to give back everything I have received. I have travelled within Europe, to USA, Egypt, and Australia!, and work with lots of different people. I am glad to say I am really oriented to <span>team-work</span> in the implementation, but also independent to think new ideas and willing to share them.</p>

        <p>My last overseas adventure is taking part now. Why Australia? Why not! I have the opportunity to improve my English, learn how to live on my own, and take an intensive course on Coding as well. Everything new, a challenge everywhere. LetÂ´s go for it!</p>
