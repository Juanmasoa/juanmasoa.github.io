        <h2>How it all started...</h2>
        <p>
            Once upon a time, a little boy looked envious how 
        his mum was paying more attention to his younger sister.
        </p>
        <p>
        Instead of breaking something or shouting, he took pencil and paper,
        and started a poem.
        </p>

        <h2>Failures</h2> 
        <p>There were some attemps to create and run a blog among various poets, but on one way or another, participation decreased and thus its content and posting frequency. I did not know how to inspire my friends to continue posting their poems. </p>
        <p>However, <strong>I learnt</strong>, and some years later I have come with a better idea and, more important, a better implementation of it.</p>
        <p>Just compare <a href="http://estrechosdms.blogspot.com">this one</a>...</p>
        <p>... to <em>this</em> one:</p>

        <p><a href="https://estrechosdemiras.com/">Estrechos de Miras</a> is a group compound of around 20 poets whose styles and senses are <em>quite heterogeneous</em>, being them passionate of the <em>same</em> thing: <strong>poetry</strong>.
       Furthermore, we collaborate with other artists such as photographers or painters who illustrate our poems, and we organize events in which poetry and music share place together.</p>
        <p>The group was founded on the values of sharing and high-quality, and its purpose, its WHY, is to create a community of artists.</p>
